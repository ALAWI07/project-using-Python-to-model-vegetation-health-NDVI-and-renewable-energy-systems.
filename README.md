## 🌿 Part 1 – Vegetation Health (NDVI Analysis)

**Goal:** Calculate and visualise vegetation health using satellite red and near-infrared reflectance data.

**Key Features**
- Computed the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI).  
- Categorised vegetation health based on NDVI ranges.  
- Calculated RMSE between measured and predicted NDVI values.  
- Visualised NDVI trends across multiple years.

**Files**
1. `Ex1.py` — main Python code implementing NDVI analysis.  
2. `Report for EX1.py.docx` — documentation describing methods and results.  
3. `ex1_question5.png` — output plot showing NDVI changes across points and years.

## ⚡ Part 2 – Renewable Energy Simulation

**Goal:** Model solar and wind power generation to evaluate renewable-energy availability throughout the year.

**Key Features**
- Simulated solar panel performance using measured intensity data.  
- Compared different solar panel types by efficiency and surface area.  
- Modelled wind-turbine rotation and power output.  
- Plotted total renewable-energy contribution and monthly trends.

**Files**
1. `Ex3.py` — Python program simulating solar and wind generation.  
2. `Report for EX3.py.pdf` — written report detailing models and findings.  
3. `ex3_question1-1.png` — wind-energy output visualisation.  
4. `ex3_question3-1.png` — combined solar and wind power plot.  
5. `ex3_question5-1.png` — extended visual analysis of system performance.
