# project-using-Python-to-model-vegetation-health-NDVI-and-renewable-energy-systems.
Python-based coursework applying programming concepts to real-world environmental and energy systems.

## ðŸŒ¿ Exercise 1 â€“ Vegetation Index (NDVI)
- Calculated vegetation health using red and near-infrared reflectance data.
- Categorized NDVI results and visualized plant health across different regions.
- Implemented functions, loops, and RMSE validation for accuracy.

## âš¡ Exercise 3 â€“ Renewable Energy Simulation
- Modelled solar and wind power generation from real-world datasets.
- Compared panel efficiencies and simulated turbine performance.
- Visualized monthly power output and total renewable contribution.

**Tools:** Python, Matplotlib, CSV, Math
